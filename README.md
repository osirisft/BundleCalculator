# BundleCalculator

##Requirements:

Social media Influencers have been basing the price of their social media post on a single post basis. So If a brand required 10 posts (for example spread over a period) then they would be charged 10x the cost of a single post. The company has decided to allow social media influencers to sell posts in bundles and charge the brand on a per bundle basis. So if the Influencer sold image based posts in bundles of 5 and 10 and brand ordered 15 they would get a bundle of 10 and a bundle of 5.

##Usage:

1. Create a txt file on your disk and input the bundle cost plan
2. Create a txt file on your disk and input the order data
3. Run Java Application "BundleCalculator"
4. Input command "upload <XXX\XXX.txt>" and press "Enter". <XXX\XXX.txt> is the bundle cost file path and file name you have created in step 1
5. Input command "cal <XXX\XXX.txt>" and press "Enter". <XXX\XXX.txt> is the order data file path and file name you have created in step 2
6. You can find the calculation result in console
